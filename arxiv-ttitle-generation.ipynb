In order to visually identify \nthe lesion from the image, an effective improved algorithm is \nneeded because of the lesion's uneven shape and border. Based \non the image's color, texture, form, and pixel intensity, the skin \nlesion is retrieved. There exists a huge number of image \nsegmentation algorithms and finding and implementing an \nappropriate algorithm for a diagnosis is a tedious and time\u0002consuming process. Moreover, it is imperative to detect and \ntreat any type of cancer in their early stages. In order to tackle \nthis issue, we compared different architectures to find out which \nalgorithm is the most efficient and brings about the best \naccuracy.

We compared the \nperformance of our approach with MIFNet, UNet, SegNet and \nFCN architectures, using the ISIC 2018 dataset.
